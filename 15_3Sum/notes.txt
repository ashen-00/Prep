The tricks to this are 
(1) Know how to avoid duplicate triplets
    Involves sorting the list, and then when you find a solution, 
    continue to move one side until you're past that value you've already added to the solutions

(2) Sliding window to find the 2 complementary value for each indexed value
    Because it's sorted, you'll never need to check backwards
